# Everything has to be within the section "cluster" because of the SO's 
# implementation. All data can also be gived at instantiation. If done so, that 
# data will supersede the data given in this file. On the other hand, if the 
# required data is neither passed during instantiation nor in this file, a 
# default value will be set by the SO which might not be according to the 
# user's needs.
# NOTE: there is an entry (icclab.haas.rootfolder) which cannot be included in
# this file as it is also needed in order to find this very file. It has to be
# delivered to the SO as an attribute additionally to every deployment call!
